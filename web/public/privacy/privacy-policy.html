        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Anglers' Log ("us", "we", or "our") operates anglerslog.ca, Anglers' Log 
            for Android, and Anglers' Log for iOS (the "App").  This page informs you 
            of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data we 
            receive from people using the App ("User") of the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
            accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Gathered</h3>
        <p>
            The following section describes data gathered by the App, and may not apply to
            external libraries used within the App ("Third Parties").  Please review the
            "Third Parties" section of this document for Privacy Policies on individual Third
            Parties used in the App.
        </p>
        <h4>Fishing Data</h4>
        <p>
            All information ("Data") gathered by the App is stored locally on the device of the 
            User.  Data is neither sent to an online server, nor shared with a Third Party unless 
            initialized by the User.
        </p>
        <h4>Location</h4>
        <p>
            A User's location is used for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>To record and save new fishing locations, and</li>
                <li>Gather current weather and atmospheric information.</li>
            </ol>
            The App does not share a User's location with any Third Party; however, Third Parties
            used in the App may explicitly request a User's current location.
        </p>
        <h4>Storage Access</h4>
        <p>
            The App requires access to the User's device storage for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>To save photos taken by the App, and</li>
                <li>To attach existing photos to Data.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Network & Internet</h4>
        <p>
            The App does not require a valid network or internet connection to function; however,
            the following features do require a valid network connection:
            <ul>
                <li>Automatic gathering of weather and atmospheric information.</li>
                <li>Data exporting and backup.</li>
                <li>Data importing.</li>
                <li>The loading and displaying of the world map.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, certain Third Parties utilize the internet in order to improve User
            experience. See the "Third Parties" section of this policy for more information.
        </p>
