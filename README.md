## Setup

For all setup instuctions and code guidelines, please refer to the [Anglers' Log Wiki](https://github.com/cohenadair/anglers-log/wiki).

## A Plea

Anglers' Log has evolved from a small school assignment into a usable, multiplatform application that I take great pride in; it has taken a lot of work and a lot of dedication. I encourage people to use my code as their own; we are all programmers helping each other learn and evolve. 

I'm only saying this for good measure as I know the majority of people are good people, but I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't redistribute Anglers' Log under another name to any platform.

Thank-you!
